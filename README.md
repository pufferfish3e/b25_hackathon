This github repository consists of the machine learning model (Percepta) for group b25.

## What Is Percepta?

Percepta is a smart, attachable camera that clips onto your glasses. Inside, it runs a lightweight machine learning model that continuously analyzes your surroundings in real time, seamlessly connecting to a companion app that collects data on nearby hazards.
